# iris - the world's worst palette generator

## wtf is iris?
iris is a work-in-progress palette generator written in C with minimal dependencies. it is loosely inspired by the pywal/cwal projects, but it doesn't depend on the same libaries; specifically libimagequant and imagemagick.

as of 0.1, it can only print out the hex codes of each pixel in a PNG file. actual palette generation is coming shortly.

P.S.: i am very much a noob at programming, and this project is my way of teaching myself C. any feedback is appreciated.
