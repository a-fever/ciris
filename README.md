# cwal - the world's worst palette generator

---

### what is cwal?
cwal is a gui-based palette generator loosely inspired by the now orphaned pywal project. currently only pngs are supported.

cwal is also my first ever programming project. my experience with C before this was also very minimal, limited to a couple of tiny projects made by following a textbook. this has been an amazing teaching experience, and i've come to really appreciate the language. oh and i didn't use any ai. vibe coding is a disease :-)

all of this is to say that if anything in the source code is redundant, ass-backwards, or otherwise idiotic, its _totally_ because of my lack of experience and definitely NOT my lack of brain cells. i also tried to include as few non-standard libraries as possible, and i would like to keep it that way. feedback and PRs are welcomed.
